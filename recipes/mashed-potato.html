    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 1/4 to 3 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salt for boiling water, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
      <li>3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>
          Add peeled and quartered potatoes to a sauce pan. Cover with cold
          water by at least 1 inch. Season with salt and garlic, and bring to a
          boil on medium-high heat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>
          Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently until potatoes are very
          soft, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and add back into the pot or
          into a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>
          Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until very smooth. Switch to a
          whisk or electric hand mixer, and whip in the olive oil in two
          additions.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>
          Season to taste with salt; serve with more olive oil drizzled over the
          top if desired.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>
    <p>
      A mild, buttery olive oil is the best choice for this recipe, rather than
      one with a peppery, grassy flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use Yukon gold potatoes, but the texture will not be as light and
      fluffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more intense garlic flavor, garlic can be finely crushed and added raw
      to the potatoes when olive oil is added.
