    <h2>How to prepare yummy chicken piquant</h2>
    <p>
      his recipe is a variation on traditional chicken piquant, which is spicy
      Cajun chicken. This comes together quickly and is good served over white
      rice.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's)</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>
        1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (such as
        RO*TEL)
      </li>
      <li>¼ cup diced sweet pickles</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>
          Mix flour and Creole seasoning together in a shallow bowl. Dredge
          chicken through flour mixture, shaking of excess.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a skillet over medium-heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until
          browned, about 2 minutes per side. Add diced tomatoes with green chile
          peppers, pickles, vinegar, capers, and garlic; simmer until chicken is
          no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. An instant-read
          thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees
          F (74 degrees C).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
      If you have concerns that this may be too spicy, there is a mild version
      of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles available.
